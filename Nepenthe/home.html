        <h2>What is Online Learning?</h2>
        <span>
            <p>Online learning is education that takes place over the Internet. It is often referred to as “elearning”
                among other terms. However, online learning is just one type of "distance learning". An online education
                is preferred by individuals who may not be able to make it for classes in a traditional brick and
                mortar kind of college due to various reasons.

                <p>Here are the 5 E's you should remember while doing your online learning: </p>
            </strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Enjoy - To make online learning fun it's better to enjoy everytime you study.</li>

                <li>Exciting - Every day will be more exciting to study because you can still be with your friends and
                    classmates.</li>

                <li>Easy - It's fun to do online learning because it's easy to access and a very convenient new way of
                    learning.</li>

            <strong><p>Bring fun into the classroom/meeting</p></strong>
            <br>
                <p>The key to get online learning more fun is to found out what motivates students to participate or focus
                in your class. Example here is to turn up the fun by playing some music which students will get along
                and enjoy listening to, chatting about a particular subject which is related to the subject, connecting
                what you're doing/lessons to the real world.</p>
